# Q. What are api endpoints for test and production?
# testnet -> https://api.testnet.blinktrade.com/tapi/v1/message
# prod -> https://api.blinktrade.com/tapi/v1/message

# Q. How to generate an api key ?
# 1. go to your exchange account
#    https://tesnet.blinktrade.com/ for testnet environment
# 2. signup
# 3. Go to API
# 4. Select a name and all the permissions for that API Key.
# 5. Get the API Key and API Secret.  The API Secret will only be shown once.   The API Password is only used in the WebSocket Api

# Q. Can I use the same API in all exchanges powered by Blinktrade?
# A. Yes, same exactly API. You only have to change the BrokerID field
#    *--------------*----*
#    | BrokerID     | ID |

#    | UrduBit      |  8 |
#    | ChileBit     |  9 |
#    *--------------*----*


# Q. How does the api works ?
# A. Though the blinktrade API, you can
